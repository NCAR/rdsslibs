The *Research Data Support System* (RDSS) was a suite of software developed
in the Atmospheric Technology Division (now Earth Observing Laboratory) of the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research in the 1980's. The libraries contained
here were the core of the system, used by packages like
[SUDS](https://github.com/NCAR/SUDS) and [Zebra](https://github.com/ncareol/Zebra).

The original Subversion repository has been converted to Git, and is kept here
for historical reference.
